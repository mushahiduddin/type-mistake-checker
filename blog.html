                        The difference between localStorage and sessionStorage has to do with lifetime and scope: how long the data is saved for and who the data is accessible to. Session storage is destroyed once the user closes the browser whereas, Local storage stores data with no expiration date.

                        In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by the window object while in Node. js, it's controlled by the global object. Block scopes are what you get when you use if statements, for statements.A global variable has global scope. A global variable is accessible from anywhere in the code. Local Scope — Local scope contains things defined inside code blocks. A local variable has local scope.

                        How event loop works in javascript?</button>

                        The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript’s asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading. Let’s take a look at what happens on the back-end. <br>The event queue is responsible for sending new functions to the stack for processing. It follows the queue data structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent for execution. <br> Whenever an async function is called, it is sent to a browser API. These are APIs built into the browser. Based on the command received from the call stack, the API starts its own single-threaded operation.

                        An example of this is the setTimeout method. When a setTimeout operation is processed in the stack, it is sent to the corresponding API which waits till the specified time to send this operation back in for processing.
                        
                        Where does it send the operation? The event queue. Hence, we have a cyclic system for running async operations in JavaScript. The language itself is single-threaded, but the browser APIs act as separate threads.
                        
                        The event loop facilitates this process; it constantly checks whether or not the call stack is empty. If it is empty, new functions are added from the event queue. If it is not, then the current function call is processed.

                        4. if return has nothing on the right side will return undefined. <br>
                        5. property that doesn't exists on an object will give you undefined. <br>
                        6. accessing array elements outside of the index range will be undefined. <br>
                        7. deleting an element inside an array will be undefined. <br>
                        8. set a value directly to undefined. <br>
